As such, i would expect a working environment like a warehouse, or other place which operates fork lifts, would have a high chance of potential foot damage. Wearing slip resistant shoes means you can have a safe and enjoyable day at work.</p><h2>It Is Not Uncommon For Employers To Adopt A Policy Requiring The Wearing Of Safety Footwear At.</h2><br/><p>Your outfit is what your customers will remember most after your service but having sore feet from uncomfortable shoes will have a detrimental effect on your attitude at work so make sure you choose uniform shoes that are appropriate for work and comfortable on.
